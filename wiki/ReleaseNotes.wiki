== HAR Viewer 2.0.9 ==
(in progress)

  * Update to RequireJS 0.24.0. This update required changes in index.php file. In case you are customizing your distribution using different index.php file, check [http://code.google.com/p/harviewer/wiki/API API]. All examples are up to date. RequireJS is not bundled together with jQuery.js anymore and you need to explicitly include both these files.
